Question: Consider the following pseudocode mentioned below.For how many times,the while loop will be executed?
Integer a
Set a = 1
while(a < 5)
       a = a + 2
end while
Print a


Solution:
When while loop is executed 1st me, a is incremented to 3, next me again it enters loop and a is 
incremented to 5. Next me, while loop is not entered. Hence while loop is executed twice.
